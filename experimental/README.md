All files in this experimental directory are expected to be good and immediately usable if desired.  However, I consider them to be experiments that don't seem useful enough to belong in the include directory.

exception_checking.h:<br/>
  PBC_ASSERT_THROWS(INVARIANT_EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION_BODY, ...)<br/>
  PBC_ASSERT_NOTHROW(INVARIANT_EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION_BODY)
